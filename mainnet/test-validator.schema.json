On top of that, alkadeta is the most active relayer operator of 5 current operators between Osmosis and Evmos with 23,932 transactions and counting. This route is the most and only active IBC route on Evmos as of now. Chances are we've relayed some of your packets to Osmosis :) Our daily avarage Evmos cost of relaying operation fees are 20 Evmos. Other than Osmosis we relay packages between Evmos<->Gravity Bridge and Evmos<->Stargaze, soon Evmos<->Agoric"
